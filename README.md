- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcbroadhead
- 👀 I’m interested in delving deeper into data analytics. I'm truly interested in being able to comprehend and sort vast amounts of information in an effective and affective manner!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different takes on SQL, R, Python, Tableau, and becoming a speed demon with sheets!i
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects both I'm immediatly interested in as well as projects I wouldn't think to start myself. My whole experience in data thus far has been to keep pushing myself; I'd like to keep that mindset moving forward! 
- 📫 How to reach me is through various forms of social medias! X: MatthewChar1es insta: matthewchar1es fb: Matthew Charles kaggle: 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My wife and I have been to 39 states and 18 different countries! We have three dogs, two cats, and seven chickens! We've built up our own homestead off of an empty acre in Northern AZ and are always looking for the next adventure!
